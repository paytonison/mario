# Assets

This project ships with placeholder art (colored shapes) and a text-based level in `assets/levels/`.

## Sound Effects (Optional)

By default, the game synthesizes simple procedural sound effects + a looping chiptune music track (no files required).

### Music (Optional)

To override the built-in music, add `assets/music.wav`.

### SFX (Optional)

If you want custom sound effects, add WAV files under `assets/sfx/` with these names:

- `jump.wav`
- `coin.wav`
- `stomp.wav`
- `powerup.wav`
- `hurt.wav`
- `win.wav`

If a file is missing, the game falls back to the built-in sound for that effect.
